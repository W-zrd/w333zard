Every time you create an account online, make a purchase, or sign up for a service, you're trusting companies with pieces of your personal information. Your name, address, phone number, and sometimes even more sensitive details like financial information become part of their digital records. They don't know that nothing is secure when they enter the internet, even the safest system could break.

In my recent bug hunting activity, I discovered a serious vulnerability that could have exposed thousands of students' personal data. What's concerning about this vulnerability is that it wasn't hidden in some obscure corner of the system. It was sitting in plain sight, in a place where users regularly interact with the website. Through an SQL injection technique, any attacker with basic knowledge could have potentially accessed the university's entire database.

This isn't just another cautionary tale about cybersecurity. This is about your data, your privacy, and your right to know how vulnerable your personal information might be. In the following section, I'll break down exactly what I found and explain in clear terms, how this security flaw could have impacted you. You don't need to be a technical expert to understand the risks â€“ you just need to care about protecting what's yours.
